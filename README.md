This project contains two challenges - a "Ticket Breakdown" challenge and a "Refactoring" challenge. The two challenges are unrelated, but you should complete both in the same folder and share the link in Coderbyte. Any written answers should be included in markdown files within this folder.

## [Ticket Breakdown](Ticket_Breakdown.md)

## [Refactoring](Refactoring.md)

If you are a JS novice, here's how to get started:

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (we use `^16`, the latest LTS)
2. Run `npm i` in this repo to install dependencies
3. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests
4. Run `npm start` to launch `index.js` for any manual testing

### Refactored code

You will find refactored code in dpk.js file. Unit tests for the code are in dpk.test.js file

### Refactoring reasoning is in the Refactoring.md file

### Ticket breakdown is in the Ticket_Breakdown.md file
